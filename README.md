# 🎮 About Me
Hi! I'm Marcelo Brito, a Game Developer and Data Scientist. With a background in Civil Engineering and a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I combine technical expertise with my passion for creating immersive gaming experiences.  

For years, I’ve worked with programming languages like **C#**, **Python**, and tools like **Unity**, which fuel my love for building games. Currently, I’m developing an indie game using Unity, where players gather resources, build defenses, and face off against hordes of enemies—a blend of roguelike and tower defense mechanics.  


- 🤖 **AI-Driven Applications**: Leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to enhance user experiences in Unity-based projects.

## 🌟 Highlight: Postgraduate Project  
This project began as part of my **final thesis** for my postgraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at PUC Minas.  

### 🌟 Project Goals  
To create an innovative solution that acts as an **"intermediary psychologist" for adolescents**, utilizing the **OpenAI API** in a fun and engaging way. The application has the following features:
- 💬 **Conversational Interface**: ChatGPT-powered conversations tailored to be engaging and interactive for teenagers.
- 📊 **Data Logging**: Conversations are saved as JSON files and securely stored in **AWS S3** for future analysis.
- 🔍 **Sentiment Analysis**: A custom **Machine Learning model** is being developed to analyze conversation content, detect emotional patterns, and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
  
### 🚀 Why This Matters  
The project is designed to support mental health professionals, providing **diagnostic insights** and detecting patterns over time. While it doesn’t replace professional counseling, it serves as an additional tool for **early detection of issues** and more targeted interventions.  

💡 The vision is to encourage recurring use of the app by adolescents, with parental support, to build a comprehensive interaction history. Over time, this data can uncover undetected emotional patterns, offering unique value in mental health support.
